# Pterodactyl-Installation-Script
A friendly Pterodactyl Installation Script. To be made as easy as possible.

 Pterodactyl Installer                                                  
                                                                        
 This script is not associated with the official Pterodactyl Project    
 Please use at your own risk.                                           
                                                                        
 This script is a complete rework and remake of                         
 https://github.com/VilhelmPrytz/pterodactyl-installer                   
                                                                        
 I made a heap of changes to it to suit myself. Then I have decided     
 to completely rewrite the script in my own what.                       
                                                                        
 For a more stable script, and one that is probably maintained better,  
 use VilhelmPrytz's script. It also supports multiple operating systems 
 While this one just supports Ubuntu 18.04                              
                                                                        
 If you wish to reuse this script or modify, feel free to do so, just   
 provide the adaquite credit

This script was designed to quickly run through the Pterodactyl
install with as much ease to the user as possible.
This script will set the panel with ssl on the machine.
This screen you see is the system's information, I would copy this down to use
throughout the setup, though it is up to you. If you're happy with the information
you see on the screen.
